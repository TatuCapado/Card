# RATB card simulation (transport validation system for Bucharest)

This is a simulation app that let you do all the action a normal card could do:
- make a monthly/daily pass or put an amount of money to charge per trip
- validate in any public transportation with a TimeStamp registration
- get a new card
- edit the database from a user-friendly interface
- adding a new customer to data base
- check when the pass expires
